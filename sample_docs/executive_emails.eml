Emily,

I need to discuss the potential acquisition of DataTech Solutions with you before our board meeting next week. This is highly confidential - please do not share with anyone outside the executive team.

Due Diligence Items:
1. Technical architecture review (need your team's assessment)
2. IP portfolio analysis - they have 12 patents pending
3. Customer concentration risk - top 3 customers = 60% of revenue
4. Integration complexity with our existing platform

Financial Projections:
- Expected synergies: $8M annually by Year 2
