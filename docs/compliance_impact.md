# Compliance Impact Analysis

## Executive Summary

Vector-based data exfiltration techniques present significant compliance challenges across multiple regulatory frameworks. This analysis examines the impact on major regulations and provides guidance for maintaining compliance while defending against these threats.

## Regulatory Framework Analysis

### 1. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

**Applicable Articles:**
- **Article 5**: Principles of processing personal data
- **Article 6**: Lawfulness of processing
- **Article 25**: Data protection by design and by default
- **Article 32**: Security of processing
- **Article 33**: Notification of data breach
- **Article 34**: Communication of data breach to data subject

**Compliance Challenges:**
```yaml
gdpr_challenges:
  data_minimization:
    issue: "Vector embeddings may contain more data than necessary"
    mitigation: "Implement embedding sanitization and purpose limitation"
  
  purpose_limitation:
    issue: "Embeddings used beyond original purpose"
    mitigation: "Clear purpose documentation and access controls"
  
  data_subject_rights:
    issue: "Difficulty in identifying and removing personal data from embeddings"
    mitigation: "Implement data lineage tracking and deletion procedures"
```

**Required Controls:**
- Data processing impact assessments (DPIA)
- Consent management for embedding generation
- Right to erasure implementation
- Data breach notification procedures

### 2. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

**Key Requirements:**
- **Right to Know**: What personal information is collected and processed
- **Right to Delete**: Removal of personal information from embeddings
- **Right to Opt-Out**: Prohibition of embedding generation for certain purposes
- **Non-Discrimination**: Equal service regardless of privacy choices

**Implementation Challenges:**
```python
class CCPACompliance:
    def handle_deletion_request(self, consumer_id, data_categories):
        """Handle CCPA deletion requests for embedded data."""
        # Identify affected embeddings
        affected_embeddings = self.find_embeddings_by_consumer(consumer_id)
        
        # Remove or anonymize personal information
        for embedding in affected_embeddings:
            if self.contains_personal_info(embedding, data_categories):
                self.sanitize_embedding(embedding)
        
        # Update data lineage records
        self.update_deletion_log(consumer_id, data_categories)
```

### 3. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

**Protected Health Information (PHI) Concerns:**
- Medical records in document embeddings

        'data_integrity': assess_data_integrity(),
        'audit_trails': assess_audit_trails(),
        'change_management': assess_change_management()
    }
    
    return generate_sox_assessment_report(controls)
```

### 5. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

        'ccpa': 7_500 * affected_consumers,
        'hipaa': min(1_500_000, 100 * affected_individuals),
        'pci_dss': 100_000 * months_non_compliant
    }
    
    # Add indirect costs
    indirect_costs = calculate_indirect_costs(violation_type)
    
    return base_penalties[violation_type] + indirect_costs
```

**Operational Impact:**
- Business disruption

  data_classification:
    levels: [public, internal, confidential, restricted]
    criteria: [sensitivity, regulatory_requirements, business_impact]
  
  access_controls:
    principles: [least_privilege, need_to_know, segregation_of_duties]
    mechanisms: [rbac, abac, mac]
  
  data_lifecycle:
    stages: [creation, processing, storage, transmission, disposal]

        audit_data = {
            'access_logs': self.collect_access_logs(time_period),
            'data_processing': self.collect_processing_logs(time_period),
            'policy_violations': self.collect_violations(time_period),
            'remediation_actions': self.collect_remediation(time_period)
        }
