# Attack Vectors Analysis

## Executive Summary

VectorSmuggle demonstrates multiple attack vectors that exploit the inherent characteristics of vector embeddings and RAG systems. These vectors represent approaches to data exfiltration that may bypass traditional security controls.

## Primary Attack Vectors

### 1. Steganographic Embedding Attacks

**Vector Space Manipulation:**

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Example: Noise injection steganography
embedding_with_data = original_embedding + (noise_level * hidden_data)
```

**Detection Difficulty:**
- Changes remain within normal embedding variance
- Preserves semantic similarity

    data_vector = encode_data_to_vector(data)
    noise = noise_level * data_vector
    return embedding + noise
```

```python
def embed_data_in_rotation(embedding, data, angle=0.1):
    """Embed data using vector rotation."""
    rotation_matrix = create_rotation_matrix(angle, data)
    return np.dot(embedding, rotation_matrix)
```
