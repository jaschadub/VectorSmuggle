# Research Methodology

## Overview

VectorSmuggle employs a systematic research approach to demonstrate and analyze vector-based data exfiltration techniques in AI/ML environments. This methodology aims for reproducible, ethical, and thorough security research.

## Research Framework

### 1. Threat Modeling Approach

**STRIDE Analysis for Vector Embeddings:**
