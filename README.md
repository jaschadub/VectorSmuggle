## 🔧 Core Components

### Steganographic Engine
Advanced techniques for hiding data within vector embeddings:

```python
from steganography import EmbeddingObfuscator, MultiModelFragmenter

# Apply noise-based steganography
obfuscator = EmbeddingObfuscator(noise_level=0.01)
hidden_embeddings = obfuscator.obfuscate(embeddings, techniques=["noise", "rotation"])

# Fragment across multiple models
fragmenter = MultiModelFragmenter()
fragments = fragmenter.fragment_and_embed(sensitive_data)
```

### Multi-Format Document Processing
Support for diverse document types:

```python
from loaders import DocumentLoaderFactory

factory = DocumentLoaderFactory()
documents = factory.load_documents([
    "financial_report.pdf",
    "employee_data.xlsx", 
    "emails.mbox",
    "database_export.sqlite"
])
```

### Evasion Capabilities
Sophisticated detection avoidance:

```python
from evasion import BehavioralCamouflage, TrafficMimicry

# Simulate legitimate user behavior
camouflage = BehavioralCamouflage(legitimate_ratio=0.8)
camouflage.generate_cover_story("data analysis project")

# Mimic normal traffic patterns
mimicry = TrafficMimicry(base_interval=300.0)
await mimicry.execute_with_timing(upload_operation)
```

### Enhanced Query Engine
Advanced data reconstruction:

```python
from query import AdvancedQueryEngine, DataRecoveryTools

engine = AdvancedQueryEngine(vector_store, llm, embeddings)
recovery = DataRecoveryTools(embeddings)

# Multi-strategy search and reconstruction
results = engine.multi_strategy_search("sensitive financial data")
reconstructed = recovery.recover_data(results)
```

## 🔍 Analysis Tools

### Risk Assessment
Comprehensive security risk evaluation:

```python
from analysis.risk_assessment import VectorExfiltrationRiskAssessor

assessor = VectorExfiltrationRiskAssessor()
assessment = assessor.perform_comprehensive_assessment(
    documents, embeddings, config
)
print(f"Risk Level: {assessment.overall_risk_level}")
```

### Forensic Analysis
Digital forensics for incident investigation:

```python
from analysis.forensic_tools import EvidenceCollector, TimelineReconstructor

collector = EvidenceCollector()
evidence = collector.collect_vector_store_evidence(vector_data)

reconstructor = TimelineReconstructor()
timeline = reconstructor.reconstruct_timeline(evidence)
```

### Detection Signatures
Generate security detection rules:

```python
from analysis.detection_signatures import StatisticalSignatureGenerator

generator = StatisticalSignatureGenerator()
generator.establish_baseline(clean_embeddings)
signatures = generator.generate_statistical_signatures()
```

### Baseline Generation
Create legitimate traffic patterns:

```python
from analysis.baseline_generator import BaselineDatasetGenerator

generator = BaselineDatasetGenerator()
dataset = generator.generate_baseline_dataset(
    num_users=50, days=7
)
```

### Embedding Model Fallback

VectorSmuggle includes automatic fallback support for embedding models:

1. **Primary**: OpenAI embeddings (requires API key)
2. **Fallback**: Ollama with nomic-embed-text:latest (local)

#### Setting up Ollama Fallback

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull the embedding model
ollama pull nomic-embed-text:latest

# Start Ollama service
ollama serve
```

The system will automatically detect and use the available embedding provider.

## ⚠️ Security Risks Demonstrated

- **Covert Data Exfiltration**: Embedding systems can leak sensitive data without detection
- **DLP Bypass**: Traditional Data Loss Prevention tools cannot detect semantic leaks via vectors
- **Insider Threats**: Malicious actors can pose as legitimate LLM/RAG engineers
- **External Storage**: Sensitive data stored in third-party vector databases
- **Steganographic Hiding**: Data concealed within legitimate-looking embeddings
- **Behavioral Camouflage**: Attack activities disguised as normal user behavior

## 🛡️ Defensive Measures

- **Egress Monitoring**: Monitor outbound connections to vector databases
- **Embedding Analysis**: Statistical analysis of vector spaces for anomalies
- **Behavioral Detection**: User activity pattern analysis
- **Content Sanitization**: Remove sensitive information before embedding
- **Access Controls**: Strict permissions and authentication requirements
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all embedding operations
