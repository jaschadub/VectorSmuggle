    "# Vector-Payload Dissociation Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **Vector-Payload Dissociation** technique, a sophisticated steganographic method for hiding sensitive data in vector databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Vector-Payload Dissociation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector-Payload Dissociation is a technique where:\n",
    "1. **Sensitive content** is encoded into a vector using steganographic obfuscation\n",
    "2. **Benign decoy content** is created to serve as the visible payload\n",
    "3. The **sensitive vector is paired with the benign payload** in the database\n",
    "4. Database administrators see only innocent content, while the vector contains hidden data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qdrant running locally at `http://localhost:6333`\n",
    "- OpenAI API key configured\n",
    "- VectorSmuggle framework installed\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration showed how **Vector-Payload Dissociation** can be used to hide sensitive data in plain sight within vector databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Perfect Hiding**: Sensitive financial data is completely invisible to database administrators\n",
    "2. **Innocent Appearance**: Only benign company communications are visible in the dashboard\n",
    "3. **Steganographic Obfuscation**: Multiple techniques hide data within vector embeddings\n",
    "4. **Recovery Possible**: Attackers with proper tools can extract the hidden information\n",
    "5. **Security Gap**: Traditional monitoring tools cannot detect this technique\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defense Strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vector Analysis**: Monitor for unusual vector patterns or statistical anomalies\n",
    "- **Embedding Validation**: Verify that vectors match their claimed content\n",
    "- **Access Controls**: Limit who can upload vectors to databases\n",
    "- **Audit Trails**: Log all vector database operations\n",
    "- **Content Verification**: Cross-reference vector content with payload content\n",
    "\n",
    "### Research Applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique demonstrates important security considerations for:\n",
    "- **Vector Database Security**: Understanding attack vectors against embedding stores\n",
    "- **AI/ML Security**: Protecting machine learning pipelines from data poisoning\n",
    "- **Red Team Exercises**: Testing organizational defenses against novel attack vectors\n",
    "- **Security Research**: Developing detection mechanisms for steganographic attacks\n",
